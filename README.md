# E-commerce website
This is a school project for my 2nd year subject CS Free Elective 2 - E-commerce.
This is designed for the proposed business, JD Couture, a company that specializes in non-formal bags. To showcase and sell their unique bag designs. We developed this project using Bootstrap, and I deployed it using Firebase. Additionally, I integrated a dummy payment method using PayPal Sandbox.

Programmers:
* Bautista, Dianne Beatriz F. 
* Madjos, Joyce A.
